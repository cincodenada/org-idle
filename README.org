#+TITLE: org-idle: Orgmode plugin that manages idle time for Neovim

* About org-idle

/Org-idle is not finished yet, this is just a proof of concept!/
It does remind you when you return from being idle and asks what you want to do, but does not act on it.
Also, this requires `xprintidle`, which is only available on linux and X11.
